# Rust todo api bench

This repo is extension of [todo-api-bench](https://github.com/dmijatovic/todo-api-bench) project. Main conclusion from todo-api-bench project is that actix-web api is clearly the fastest solution I have tested. Based on this conclusion I decided to further explore Rust programming language and its ecosystem. In this project I explore various http server libraries and compare their performance in similair way as I did in todo-api-bench project. We still use Postgres todo database and autocannon for load tests.
